## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Kaydiann**, a  graduate with a B.S. in **Brain and Cognitive Science**, currently working on developing my skills in **Data Science** and **Data Analysis**. I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights and drive decision-making. I specialize in data cleaning, statistical analysis, machine learning, and building data visualizations.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Building data science projects, including **predictive modeling**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **time series forecasting**.
- Expanding my skills in **machine learning** and **deep learning**, particularly in **recommendation systems** and **natural language processing (NLP)**.
- Working on projects involving data analysis and visualization using **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- **SQL** for advanced querying and database management.
- **Python** (scikit-learn, TensorFlow) to improve my machine learning skills.
- **JavaScript** to enhance my ability to build interactive visualizations.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** projects, especially those involving **predictive modeling**, **NLP**, or **recommendation systems**.
- Collaborative efforts to improve data-driven decision-making through the power of analytics.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
- Gaining more hands-on experience with **deploying machine learning models** in production.
- Improving my knowledge in **cloud computing platforms** (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) for machine learning projects.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- **Data Analysis** workflows, including how to perform EDA, data cleaning, and statistical analysis.
- **Programming languages**: Python, R, SQL, and **data visualization** tools like **ggplot2**, **matplotlib**, and **Plotly**.
- Insights into **Brain and Cognitive Science** research, particularly as it intersects with **data science**.
